This is the step-by-step preparation of red sauce pasta:

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Saute bell peppers or onions on a high flame just for 2 minutes. You can also skip bell peppers and use onion. The taste would be different but good Set them aside to cool.

2. To the same pan, add ripe tomatoes and saute for 2 to 3 minutes.

3. Tomatoes must turn soft. Add red chilli flakes as needed. Set the aside to cool.

4. When cooled, add them to a blender jar.

5. Blend to smooth or coarse paste. We prefer smooth. Set this aside.

6. While you make the sauce, you can bring 2 litres water to boil in a large pot. Add salt as needed.

7. When the water comes to a boil, add pasta. Cool al dente following the instructions on the pack.

8. Drain off in a colander and rinse to remove extra starch.

9. Put back the same pan on the stove with another 1 tablespoon oil. When hot saute garlic and red chilli flakes until they turn fragrant.

10. Add chopped onions.

11. Saute until the raw smell goes away.

12. Add the puree and salt. Mix and cook an a medium heat until the sauce thickens.

13. The consistency I prefer is generally thick but you can take pff a little earlier. Add oregano. Mix well. Off the stove.

14. Add the cooked pasta. I prefer another tablespoon olive oil now. This is optional.

15. Saute until well combined.

Add crushed pepper. Serve pasta in red sauce hot.
